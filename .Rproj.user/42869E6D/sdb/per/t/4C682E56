This includes simulation of the isotope pattern, the pattern generated by several charge states which are usually observed. In a later stage the resolution of the mass spectrometer shall be included to have an idea of the influence of the resolution to the observed isotopic pattern.\n\n#Further features might be the simulation of a mass spectrum by UniProt Accession instead of Protein Sequence, which is possible by looking up the sequence from UniProt, and the generation of a comparision plot to a measured spectrum for protein identification and publication purposes.\n\n# +++ToDo+++\n\n#* Add code to calculate chemical formula from protein sequence, allow addition of common modfications\n#* Utilize isotope distribution simulation from http://orgmassspec.github.io/\n#* Add spectra generation\n#* Add resolution simulation for orbitrap mass spectrometers\n#* Add spectra import of as a list of mass and intensity\n#* Plot head to tails comparision plot with ggplot\n\n\n# +++Code+++\n\n#source(\"https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")\n#biocLite(\"UniProt.ws\")\nlibrary(UniProt.ws)\n\n#library(\"OrgMassSpecR\")\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(\"plyr\")\n\nsource(\"Functions.R\")\n\n\nup <- UniProt.ws(9796)\n\nproteinAccession <- \"P68082\"\n\nproteinSequence <- select(up, proteinAccession, \"SEQUENCE\", \"UNIPROTKB\")[,2]\n\nproteinChemForm <- pepToForm(proteinSequence, output = \"list\")\n\nMonoisotopicMass(proteinChemForm)\n\nisotopeDist <- IsotopicDistribution(proteinChemForm, charge = 20)\n\nggplot(isotopeDist, aes(mz, percent)) + geom_point()\nggplot(isotopeDist, aes(mz, ymin = 0, ymax = percent)) + geom_linerange()\n\n \naspirin <- IsotopicDistribution( list(C = 9, H = 8, O = 4))\nggplot(aspirin, aes(mz, ymin = 0, ymax = percent, colour = \"red\")) + geom_linerange()\n\n\n\nmyo <- read.csv2(\"Spectrum_Myoglobin.csv\", sep = \",\", dec = \".\" )\ncolnames(myo) <- c(\"mz\", \"intensity\")\np <- ggplot()\np <- p + geom_line(data =  myo, aes(mz, intensity)) \np + xlim(c(950,1050))\n\nmyo_sim <- generateDist( charge = 30:10, removeFirstM = TRUE)\np <- p + geom_vline(data = myo_sim, aes(xintercept = mz, colour = \"red\"))\np + xlim(c(990,1010))\n\n",
